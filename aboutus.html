      <!-- Focus 1 -->
      <div class="focus-item">
        <h3>Focus 1: Tailored System Architecture</h3>
        <p>
          Stop forcing your business into rigid software. We start by deeply
          understanding your specific industry, workflow, and business model
          (e.g., e-commerce, wholesale, manufacturing). Stockit then delivers a
          system architecture and feature set custom-engineered to solve your
          unique, direct inventory challenges.
        </p>

      <!-- Focus 2 -->
      <div class="focus-item">
        <h3>Focus 2: Uncompromising Data Precision</h3>
        <p>
          Eliminate the cost and risk of inaccurate counts, phantom stock, and
          unexpected write-offs. Our foundation is unwavering accuracy and
          real-time synchronization, ensuring you always know exactly what you
          have, where it is, and when you need to reorder—leading to better cash
          flow management.
        </p>
      </div>

      <!-- Focus 3 -->
      <div class="focus-item">
        <h3>Focus 3: Direct Profit Optimization</h3>
        <p>
          Inventory management should not just be a cost center; it should drive
          revenue. By eliminating operational waste, preventing stockouts, and
          optimizing your purchasing based on precise forecasts, Stockit
          translates efficiency directly into measurable profit growth for your
          business.
